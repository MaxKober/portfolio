        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Continuum Group Ukraine</p>
        <p>
          Port City in Lutsk is a regional shopping and entertainment center with non-food retail, cinemas, bowling, a roller-drome,
          cafés and restaurants, offices, and an underground parking level. The architectural concept and interior design were prepared
          by <strong>UGNIA (Lithuania)</strong>. <strong>Altis</strong> acted as the lead design company and general contractor for the project,
          developing the full schematic design package, obtaining all authority approvals and the building permit, creating a coordinated
          BIM model to eliminate design conflicts, and issuing the IFC package for construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Project Manager I coordinated the design development between UGNIA, Altis’s in-house engineers, and local authorities,
          and then oversaw project delivery, covering all major construction stages from deep foundations and superstructure to envelope,
          MEP systems, vertical transportation, and interior fit-outs.

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Scope of Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Design &amp; Permitting:</strong> concept and interiors by UGNIA → adaptation by Altis; full schematic design;
            BIM model to avoid design snags; authority approvals; building permit; IFC documentation issued for all disciplines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Groundworks &amp; Substructure:</strong> relocation of the existing 600 mm water main out of the building footprint;
            bored injection piles for excavation support and under the main building; excavation of the pit, weak-soil replacement,
            drainage; precast RC piles (jacked) for the retaining wall along Sukhomlynskogo St with factory RC panels using Reckli
            liners for architectural concrete; tie/capping beams; slab-on-grade for parking and slab at –0.10.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Superstructure &amp; Envelope:</strong> vertical RC elements (columns, lift and stair cores); erection of
            ≈3,200 t structural steel frame including 36 m-span trusses over the roller-drome; composite slabs on profiled deck;
            ≈150 t of secondary steel for partitions and façade framing; full enclosing structures using KingSpan and ArcelorMittal
            panel systems; all glazed/transparent envelope elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. MEP, Energy &amp; Life Safety:</strong> internal engineering networks and plant rooms (ventilation rooms,
            transformer substation, diesel generator); vertical transportation (travelators, escalators
