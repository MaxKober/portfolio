        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> Continuum Group Ukraine</p>
        <p>
          Port City in Lutsk is a regional shopping and entertainment center with non-food retail, cinemas, bowling, a roller-drome,
          cafés and restaurants, offices, and an underground parking level. The architectural concept and interior design were prepared
          by <strong>UGNIA (Lithuania)</strong>. <strong>Altis</strong> acted as the lead design company and general contractor for the project,
          developing the full schematic design package, obtaining all authority approvals and the building permit, creating a coordinated
          BIM model to eliminate design conflicts, and issuing the IFC package for construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Project Manager I coordinated the design development between UGNIA, Altis’s in-house engineers, and local authorities,
          and then oversaw project delivery, covering all major construction stages from deep foundations and superstructure to envelope,
          MEP systems, vertical transportation, and interior fit-outs.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Scope of Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1. Design &amp; Permitting:</strong> concept and interiors by UGNIA → adaptation by Altis; full schematic design;
            BIM model to avoid design snags; authority approvals; building permit; IFC documentation issued for all disciplines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Groundworks &amp; Substructure:</strong> relocation of the existing 600 mm water main out of the building footprint;
            bored injection piles for excavation support and under the main building; excavation of the pit, weak-soil replacement,
            drainage; precast RC piles (jacked) for the retaining wall along Sukhomlynskogo St with factory RC panels using Reckli
            liners for architectural concrete; tie/capping beams; slab-on-grade for parking and slab at –0.10.
          </li>
          
            <li><strong>Superstructure &amp; Envelope:</strong> Reinforced-concrete verticals (columns, lift and stair cores);
            erection of ≈3,200 t steel frame including 36 m-span trusses over the roller-drome; composite slabs on metal deck;
            ≈150 t secondary steel for enclosures and partitions; complete façade and roof assemblies using KingSpan and ArcelorMittal systems plus glazed elements.
            <em>At the client’s request, ≈600 tonnes of prefabricated steel originally fabricated for another of their projects were
            re-engineered and incorporated into the PortCity structural frame, adding significant design and installation complexity.</em></li>
            
          
          <li>
            <strong>4. MEP, Energy &amp; Life Safety:</strong> internal engineering networks and plant rooms (ventilation rooms,
            transformer substation, diesel generator); vertical transportation (travelators, escalators, passenger/service lifts);
            utility entries and stormwater pump stations; active fire-protection systems (smoke extraction, pressurization, sprinkler
            and hose systems with tanks and pump room, automatic fire alarm, voice evacuation, fire post); internal cold/hot water,
            sanitary and storm drainage; ventilation, heating and cooling on chiller–fan-coil scheme; <strong>4.5 MW gas boiler plant</strong>;
            low-voltage systems (LAN, CCTV, security, access control) and BMS/dispatching; passive fire-protection measures
            (firestopping, fire doors, fire-rated glazing).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5. Fit-out &amp; Site:</strong> premium public-area finishes, offices and tenant zones, BOH finishes, doors and
            gates, multimedia systems (background music, exterior LED screen, wayfinding), on-site roads and parking, landscaping
            and small architectural forms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Delivering a large multi-program retail and entertainment center on Sukhomlynskoho 1 amid economic and political instability required
          maintaining progress and cost certainty through a volatile currency environment and tight logistics.
          At the client’s request, ≈600 tonnes of prefabricated steel produced for another of their projects had to be reused and integrated into the main structural system,
          introducing additional coordination, design adaptation, and installation challenges.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Altis applied BIM coordination from early stages, phased the works into substructure, superstructure, and MEP packages,
          and ran procurement concurrently with design finalization to reduce schedule risk. Strong coordination of fire protection,
          vertical transportation, and low-voltage systems ensured full system integration and a single, testable handover.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Result</h2>
        <p>
          The project was successfully completed and commissioned despite significant political and economic challenges in the country,
          including the national currency fluctuation from 8 to 16 UAH per USD. Port City opened as a fully operational, shopping and entertainment complex, meeting both client and tenant expectations.
