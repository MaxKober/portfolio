        <h2>Overview</h2>

        </p>
       <p>
          This flagship project stands as one of the most complex and rewarding achievements of my career —
          an iconic, architecturally significant heritage redevelopment in the heart of Kyiv,
          delivered under a Design-Build / General Contracting model.
          I led full-cycle design coordination and construction execution. <!--,
          driving cost optimization, stakeholder alignment, and a successful, bonus-awarded handover
          under highly accelerated schedule constraints.-->
       </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Scope of Work</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Design &amp; Documentation:</strong> As the project’s lead design company, <strong>Altis</strong> executed full design development and technical detailing. International consultants 
            <strong><a href="https://www.benoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Benoy</a></strong> and 
            <strong><a href="https://studiofouriv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">Studio Four IV</a></strong> (London) were engaged for interior conceptual design. During the detailed-design stage, all conceptual solutions were comprehensively reworked and fully redeveloped by Altis to meet Ukrainian building codes and local by-law requirements while maintaining the original design intent.
          </li>

          <li>Delivered full <strong>Issued for Construction (IFC)</strong> drawing and specification packages across all disciplines — structural (reinforced-concrete frame), architectural, MEP (HVAC, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, vertical transportation, low-voltage), and interior design — ensuring complete coordination between architectural intent, engineering systems, and material finishes.</li>

          <li><strong>Construction Methodology:</strong> Developed detailed <em>Method Statements</em> and sequencing of construction operations for each phase of work, defining logistics strategies, safety procedures, and temporary utilities layouts to ensure efficient and safe execution within a constrained urban environment.</li>

          <li><strong>Construction Management:</strong> Organized site setup, tower cranes, temporary power, access, and safety enclosures.</li>
          <li>Supervised completion of monolithic reinforced-concrete frame, columns, slabs, and shear cores with quality and geodetic control.</li>
          <li>Implemented structural monitoring for settlements, vibrations, and façade deformations.</li>
          <li>Managed roofing, façade, and glazing works in accordance with heritage preservation requirements.</li>
          <li>Directed MEP installation, sprinkler and smoke-control systems, elevators, and high-end retail interior finishes.</li>

          <li><strong>Extra Low Voltage (ELV) systems:</strong> CCTV surveillance, Wi-Fi, structured LAN network, security alarm system, anti-theft detection gates, background music, and public address / evacuation announcement system.</li>

          <li><strong>Power Backup:</strong> Installation and commissioning of a diesel generator system to provide emergency power for life-safety and critical retail operations.</li>

          <li>Oversaw final landscaping, testing, commissioning, and documentation handover.</li>

          <li><strong>Personal Contribution:</strong> Joined the project at approximately <strong>85 % structural frame</strong> and <strong>80 % façade completion</strong>, assuming responsibility for coordination of finishing trades, MEP integration, and luxury fit-out delivery through to successful handover.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Deliver the complete reconstruction of Kyiv’s historic TSUM department store — including structure, MEP, and luxury interiors — in less than one year, while preserving the building’s heritage façade and maintaining a safe work environment for a peak workforce exceeding 600 people on site simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Executed phased construction with overlapping trade activities and extended work shifts to meet the accelerated schedule. Implemented strict heritage protection protocols and comprehensive safety management systems, supported by 3D coordination to resolve design conflicts and streamline construction sequencing.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Result</h2>
        <p>
          Achieved zero lost-time incidents throughout delivery despite high manpower density and schedule pressure. Completed the full scope within the targeted 10-month window, realizing an 8 % cost saving through value engineering, strategic procurement, and optimized sequencing. The project was successfully handed over on schedule and received a performance bonus for exceptional delivery.
