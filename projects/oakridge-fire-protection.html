         <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Client:</strong> 
          <a href="https://https://div15mechanical.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link">DIVISION 15 / </a>

        <p>
          Gisborne has been awarded significant fire protection work on the Oakridge Development — one of the largest mixed‑use projects in Canadian history. The 4.7–5.5 million sq ft redevelopment includes commercial, residential, and office space, 14 residential towers, a community centre, office space, and a new transit concourse. We're working hard on fire protection for 6 towers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stakeholder structure: GC → MEP Contractors (Division 15 Mechanical Ltd., True Mechanical, Gisborne) → Fire Protection Delivery.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Towers 1 & 2 — Completed under Kanin Construction with full wet and dry sprinkler systems installation.</li>
          <li>Towers 3, 4, 6 & 7 — Initially under EllisDon, with Towers 3 & 4 later transferred to Peak Construction; 70% of fire protection scope completed at time of transfer.</li>
          <li>North-East Office Building — VDC + sprinkler system delivery (approx. 10% completed).</li>
          <li>Transit Plaza to Oakridge–41st Station — Pricing and scope refinement under negotiation.</li>
          <li>Full integration of fire protection into BIM/VDC workflows to avoid clashes with MEP and structural systems.</li>
          <li>Coordination of equipment procurement, insulation and heat trace installation, and firestopping across all active areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Significant schedule delays by general contractors and unsigned change orders caused the company to exceed initial budgets for some towers. Concurrent multi-GC environments added complexity to coordination, procurement, and change management.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Conducted meticulous analysis of all IFC design revisions and changes affecting fire protection scope. Implemented root‑cause tracking to identify productivity impacts and support negotiation of outstanding changes. Strengthened VDC coordination, streamlined RFI processing, and optimized sequencing with superintendents and subtrades.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:16px">Result</h2>
        <p>
          Enabled more accurate forecasting and improved control of cost impacts. Fire protection installation continued efficiently across towers despite schedule pressures, with improved coordination and documentation supporting future claims and change resolution.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The presence of two independent MEP consultants led to conflicting design-joint layouts, creating misalignment between fire protection, mechanical, structural, and architectural elements.</p>
</section>

<section class="case-block">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>Coordinated joint locations across all trades, facilitated consultant resolution meetings, and established standardized interface details to align modelling requirements and installation sequences.</p>
</section>

<section class="case-block">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>A fully coordinated set of joint details was achieved, preventing downstream clashes, reducing rework risk, and ensuring seamless integration of fire protection systems within the broader MEP design.</p>
</section>
  <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Coordinated joint locations between all consultants, led resolution meetings, and standardized interface details.</p>
  <p><strong>Result:</strong> Achieved a fully coordinated model and prevented construction-stage rework.</p>
